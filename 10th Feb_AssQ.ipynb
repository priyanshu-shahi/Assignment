    "# ANSWER 6.\n",
    "# In Python, `write()` and `writelines()` are methods used to write data to a file.\n",
    "# write() :\n",
    "#  - It takes a single argument, which is the string or bytes you want to write to the file.\n",
    "#  - It writes the data at the current position of the file pointer and advances the pointer to the end of the written data.\n",
    "#  - If the file doesn't exist, it creates the file. If the file exists, it overwrites the existing content.\n",
    "# Example :\n",
    "with open('file.txt', 'w') as f:\n",
    "       f.write('Hello World')\n",
    "\n",
    "# writelines():\n",
    "# - `writelines()` is used to write a sequence of strings to a file.\n",
    "# - It takes an iterable (e.g., a list or tuple) of strings as an argument and writes each string to the file without adding any separators or newlines.\n",
    "# - It doesn't automatically add line breaks between the lines, so you need to include them if you want newlines.\n",
    "# Example :\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   lines = ['Line 1', 'Line 2', 'Line 3']\n",
    "   with open('file.txt', 'w') as file:\n",
    "       file.writelines(lines)\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "To add line breaks when using `writelines()`, you can modify the data before writing it to the file, like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "lines = ['Line 1\\n', 'Line 2\\n', 'Line 3\\n']\n",
    "with open('file.txt', 'w') as file:\n",
    "    file.writelines(lines)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember that `write()` is suitable for writing individual strings or data, while `writelines()` is useful when you have a list of strings to write to a file without adding any separators.\n"
